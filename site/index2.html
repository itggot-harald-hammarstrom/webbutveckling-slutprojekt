            <div class="lÃ¥da">
                <p class="historytext1">In the 16th century, snuff (pulverized tobacco), the precursor of snus (moist snuff), was introduced to France by French diplomat Jean Nicot, who worked at the court of King Henry II of France. He recommended snuff to Catherine de' Medici as a migraine remedy. When she became a regular user of snuff, it became a fashion among the court and upper-class citizens of France, especially among females, as it was deemed more socially acceptable than other forms of tobacco.</p>
                <p class="historytext2">This trend of using snuff in the nose also spread to Sweden at the beginning of the 17th century. In the 18th century, Swedish producers began to manufacture moist snuff, which was placed in the lower lip and did not require spitting. It became known as snus. Ettan (meaning "the number one"), registered since 1822, is the oldest brand of snus still sold.</p>
                <p class="historytext3">It is a popular myth that snus or any other forms of smokeless tobacco contains fiberglass, or glass particles, as an aid to the absorption of nicotine by the user's blood. This is not true.[6] Mucous membranes readily absorb free nicotine. The burning sensation is caused by the nicotine itself (similar to the tingle of nicotine gum) and some food additives such as sodium carbonate (E500). Sodium carbonate is a food additive used to increase the pH of the tobacco (reduce the acidity). This increases the bioavailability of the nicotine, meaning more is available for absorption. Some flavorings (mints in particular) are astringent and may increase the tingling or burning sensation.</p>
